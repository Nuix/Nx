=begin
This script will demonstrate showing a simple progress dialog while processing some data into a case.
The script will allow the user to abort processing while processing is happening.  To accomplish this
processing is started asynchrounously using the method Processor.processAsync vs the more common approach
Processor.process.  The reason for this is that while processing is occurring we need to poll the progress
dialog to see if the user has requested an abort.  If we were to call Processor.process, we would not be
able to do this because that is a blocking call, meaning that execution does not return to our script until
processing has completed and returned control to the script.  When we instead call Processor.processAsync
Nuix will begin processing asynchronously, provide a ProcessingJob object and immediately return control to
our script, allowing use to check for and act on the user requesting we abort.
